# JuicyLoris
Spectral Morphing Library from early 00's

See: http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/

This repo is an attempt to Archive and modernise an old Spectral Morphing library called Loris, historically it existed as an application called Lemur. (Which is hard to find any trace of on the internet)

This library is alos used in the Kyma hardware sound computer, where there's a real time implementation that uses .SPC files. The Loris library creates .SDIF files, that once analysis has been done, it's quicker to synthesise from. However it's not the ideal format for block based audio processing, as the timing envelope brakpoints are not evenly spaced. There is a SCP File.cpp in the source, which enables writing to SPC  

# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
```
cd into folder

cmake -B builds

cmake --build Builds
```
And you will have an exectutable in the Builds folder called "HelloLorris-0.0.0"

# RATIONALE:

A number of people have tried to make the Spectral Morphing library work on Windows and Mac, and failed at the arcane gibberish that is AutoMake/AutoConf. The original Package did a lot, including making a Python library, and CSound opcodes. This is not the intention here. 

I wanted a conscise easy to use static library that could be included in Juce Projects, or other C++ projects, and be made with CMake and more modern C++ standards. 

The moving over to modern C++ standards will be gradual, and I'd appreciate any help or advice. 

There's a reliance on iterators, as the c++ version used to originally write the library didn't have range based for loops.

There's a number of iffy bits in the code, seemingly lots of raw pointers. I've changed the auto_ptr to using unique_ptr, and made a few other edits. 

These are lines I've made a quick note of:
